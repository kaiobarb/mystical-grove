### Group Members:
- Aaron Kanehl - Fire Crystal, water crystal

### Objective:
As the final project of CMPM 163, we want to showcase a variety of interesting visual effects. We will create an aesthetically pleasing grove that will be the home to our VFX.
Each member will design a magical/elemental crystal that showcases an effect that they are fond of.

In our final scene, we aim to have the following effects implemented:
 - Vertex Displacement
 - Translucency
 - Caustics
 - Emission
 - Custom Lighting
 - Fog and Godrays
